## Installation

You may install the NFC plugin from either GitHub or from NPM. Then, insert the nfc plugin in your `vaken.config.ts` file.

## Use Cases

NFC allows you to associate hackers, sponsors, and organizers in your database with NFC tags if they have them. This then allows you to easily keep track of how people are checking into different events, attendance levels at different points throughout the event, and more.
