## What are plugins?

Plugins are well-defined sets of features that may be integrated with Vaken. These include things such as certain OAuth libraries, NFC, sponsor management, and Google Calendar event syncing, which also integrates with NFC.

## Why plugins?

Plugins allow users to customize Vaken to their use case, and easily extend Vaken without having to heavily directly code within Vaken.
