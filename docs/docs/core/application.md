## Overview

Core to the functionality of Vaken, the application is the key feature that allows hackers to answer the questions that you set forth, upload a résumé, and check whatever ToS that you may require.

## Customizing the Application

The questions that are utilized in the application are in the [application.js](https://github.com/VandyHacks/vaken/blob/staging/src/client/assets/application.js) file, and are automatically loaded into the corresponding React components.
