# Overview

In this document, we will demonstrate the "hacker table", a core feature of Vaken that allows organizers to view and manage hackers.

## The Hacker Table

The hacker table is only displayed to people that have the `UserType: Organizer`. You can enable users with the Organizer type by utilizing the `makeOrganizer.ts` script in the `scripts` folder.

The hacker table centralizes management, allowing the organizer to view application answers, uploaded resumes, and accept, reject, and manage hackers. It also provides powerful filters, and a search that supports RegEx.
