## Welcome to Vaken!

First off, we'd love to welcome you to Vaken! We hope that it solves for different registration, authentication, and tracking needs that you have for your event so that you can focus on what you want.

## Who is this for?

We developed Vaken to be used by a large range of peopleâ€“it's not just for one type of event. We designed it for:

- Hackathons
- Large events
- Small events
- Any event that needs an applicant tracking system
- Anything other event!

Furthermore, the [plugin system](plugins/overview.md) was developed so that you can customize Vaken with just the installation of a handful of packages.

## How do I get started?

That's on the next page, [installation!](installation.md)
